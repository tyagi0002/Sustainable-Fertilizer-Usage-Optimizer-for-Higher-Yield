# Sustainable Fertilizer Usage Optimizer for Higher Yield

This project builds a machine learning model to predict suitable fertilizers based on environmental and soil conditions using a dataset of crop types. It involves data loading, exploratory analysis, preprocessing (including encoding and scaling), training a Random Forest classifier, and optimizing hyperparameters with Grid Search. The model is saved for future use, and an example prediction demonstrates its application. This work aims to assist farmers in selecting appropriate fertilizers for better crop yield.
